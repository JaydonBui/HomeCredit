# Customer Segmentation & Market Insight Analysis for Loan Product GTM Strategy

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my project, 
This is where I dive into customer segmentation, market research, and a bit of A/B testing to figure out how to sell loans smarter with GTM strategy. This is based on my experience at Home Credit Vietnam, but let me clarify—this is more about understanding why customer segmentation is key and how to use it strategically.

Note: 
Some details will be hidden due to company data privacy, but I’ll walk you through the thought process, research insights, and testing methods. If you want to geek out over this or chat more about any part, ping me for a coffee! ☕

So, what’s this project about?
I worked on a loan product launch strategy with a goal of generating 7,200 leads in a short period. The challenge? We needed to target the right audience with digital campaigns while making sure we weren’t wasting marketing spend. That’s where customer segmentation and market insights came into play!

Here’s what I did, before jump into any executiton, I always start with customer-focused analysis:
✔️ Dug deep into market research 📊 – Studied how people in Vietnam borrow money, what they borrow for, and which loan providers they prefer.
✔️ Segmented potential customers 🎯 – Broke them down by loan purpose, age, gender, and borrowing behavior.


✔️ Came up with hypotheses 🤔 – Example: Women tend to borrow for family expenses, while younger people go for quick, unsecured loans via mobile.
✔️ Ran A/B tests 🔄 – Tested different campaigns to see what worked best for each segment.
✔️ Refined the strategy 🚀 – Based on the results, optimized marketing spend for digital channels like Facebook, Google Ads, and Zalo.
