# Customer Segmentation & Market Insight Analysis for Loan Product GTM Strategy

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my project, 
This is where I dive into customer segmentation, market research, and a bit of A/B testing to figure out how to sell loans smarter with GTM strategy. This is based on my experience at Home Credit Vietnam, but let me clarifyâ€”this is more about understanding why customer segmentation is key and how to use it strategically.

Note: 
Some details will be hidden due to company data privacy, but Iâ€™ll walk you through the thought process, research insights, and testing methods. If you want to geek out over this or chat more about any part, ping me for a coffee! â˜•
