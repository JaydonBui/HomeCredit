# 🚀 Customer Segmentation & Market Insight Analysis for Loan Product GTM Strategy 

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my project, 
This is where I dive into customer segmentation, market research, and a bit of A/B testing to figure out how to sell loans smarter with GTM strategy, unlocking a 30% Increase in Loan Applications post campaign. 

Before we dive in, just a quick note: Some details are hidden due to company data privacy. I’ll give you a clear overview of the thought process, strategy, and insights that made this work. If you want to chat more about any part of this, ping me for a coffee chat! ☕️

So, what’s this project about?
I worked on a loan product launch strategy with a goal of generating 7,200 leads in a short period. The challenge? We needed to target the right audience with digital campaigns while making sure we weren’t wasting marketing spend. That’s where customer segmentation and market insights came into play!

🎯 The Problem: Who Actually Needs These Loans?
We wanted to launch a new cash loan product and needed to figure out:

1. Who are the right customers?
2. What are they borrowing for?
3. Where do they usually get their loans?
4. How can we tailor our messaging to get more leads & better conversions?
   
So, instead of guessing, I dug into market data, surveyed customer behavior, and tested different audience segments.

🔬 Research & Findings

1️⃣ Who Are Our Customers?
After analyzing market reports & our own customer data, we found that:

✅ Men tend to borrow for electronics & home appliances

✅ Women are more likely to take loans for child-related expenses

✅ Young professionals need loans for lifestyle & business growth

💡 Key Takeaway: Loan needs vary by gender, age, and lifestyle. Understanding this helps us craft better offers.

2️⃣ How Do Customers Behave Digitally?

📈 Search trends showed a rising interest in “instant” and “unsecured” loans.

📲 More customers searched for mobile app loans instead of visiting branches.

💬 Social media engagement was higher when loan offers focused on convenience & flexibility.

3️⃣ Defining the Customer Journey: Why It Matters

Understanding the customer journey is like having a roadmap to guide potential borrowers from initial interest to loan approval. In my analysis, I drew insights from the ACL customer journey map, which highlights key touchpoints and behaviors throughout the process.

Here’s why mapping the customer journey is a game-changer:
- Optimizes Conversion Rates: By visualizing each step, we can spot drop-off points (e.g., between the landing page and the input info page)
- Enhances Targeting & Retargeting: Knowing where customers drop off allows for tailored messaging.
- Improves Channel Strategy: The journey map distinguishes between owned, paid, and web channels, showing which are most effective at each stage.
- Personalizes the Customer Experience: If a customer already visited the "Input Info Page", the retargeting ad could pre-fill information for a smoother process for example.

4️⃣ Channel Strategies: Reaching the Right Audience in the Right Places

Alright, so we know our audience is super active online, but where exactly are they hanging out? Based on their digital behaviors, here’s how we can meet them where they are and drive engagement.

🔹 Social Media Powerhouses – Facebook & Zalo dominate! That’s where most of our audience spends their time.
🔹 Diverse Online Activities – They browse, shop, watch videos, read blogs, and even listen to podcasts.
🔹 Affinity Index – Some platforms work better than others, meaning we should double down on what’s working and not waste resources elsewhere.

🧪 Testing & Results

To validate our findings, I ran A/B tests on different audience groups:

✅ Tested marketing messages:

- Group A: Focused on child-related loan needs for women.

- Group B: Promoted fast, unsecured loans for digital-savvy users.
  
✅ Measured impact:

- Higher engagement from moms & families when messaging included education & child expenses.

- Better conversion on mobile-first campaigns, proving that digital lending is the way forward.

📌 Early Results:

✅ 30% Lower Cost-Per-Lead (CPL) when using Facebook Lookalike Audiences instead of broad targeting.

✅ 15% Increase in Loan Application Completion after simplifying form fields and adding auto-fill features.

✅ CTR Improvement of 25% when testing different ad creatives with personalized finance tips.

✅ 50% Higher Engagement on Zalo than expected, leading to increased investment in Zalo-specific campaigns.

🚀 Final Strategy & Takeaways: The Winning Formula

Based on real data & performance insights, here’s our refined strategy for maximum impact:

1️⃣ Social Media: The Core Driver - Main Focus: Facebook & Zalo Ads – Continue optimizing for lower CPL & higher conversions.

2️⃣ SEO & SEM: Be There When They Search -  Invest More in Google Ads – Since 65%+ of loan inquiries start with search.

3️⃣ Conversion Rate Optimization: Less Friction, More Loans - Form Simplification to maintain high application completion rates.
